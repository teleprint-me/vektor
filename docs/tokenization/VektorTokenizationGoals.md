# Vektor Tokenization System Goals

## Main Goals Document

1. **Language Agnosticism**: Develop a tokenization system versatile enough to
   handle various languages and scripts, focusing on adaptability to different
   linguistic phenomena.

2. **Semantic Preservation**: Prioritize maintaining the semantic integrity of
   the text in the tokenization process, exploring methods that integrate
   semantic understanding directly into tokenization.

3. **Efficiency**: Aim for a computationally efficient tokenization method
   suitable for large datasets, including the implementation of effective
   compression schemes for token representation.

4. **Innovation**: Experiment with innovative tokenization approaches, moving
   beyond established methods like WordPiece or BPE, to foster creative and
   potentially groundbreaking solutions in NLP.

5. **Machine Learning Compatibility**: Ensure the tokenized output is optimized
   for machine learning models, particularly in NLP tasks, evaluating
   tokenization quality based on its impact on model performance.

6. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: Establish benchmarks and a systematic
   evaluation process for the tokenization system, comparing it against current
   methodologies to assess effectiveness.

7. **Community Engagement and Feedback**: Actively engage with the NLP and
   open-source communities through platforms such as GitHub, forums, and
   conferences to gather and incorporate feedback.

8. **Research and Development**: Stay abreast of the latest NLP research and
   advancements, applying insights from academic literature to enhance the
   tokenization system's development.

9. **Iterative Improvement**: Adopt an iterative development approach, using
   each iteration as a learning and improvement opportunity toward achieving the
   final goal.

10. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation of the
    project's progress and methodologies, facilitating future work and
    replication of the project.
