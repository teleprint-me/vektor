# Exploration of Cosine Similarity with Encoded Token Vectors

Cosine similarity is a key metric in NLP for measuring semantic similarity
between vectors. Its application with dense embeddings from context-aware models
is well-known. However, using cosine similarity with encodings, rather than
embeddings, offers an innovative approach that could yield valuable insights.

## Steps to Utilize Cosine Similarity with Encoded Vectors

1. **Vector Representation**: Obtain sparse vectors by mapping encoded tokens to
   a high-dimensional space. Consider the influence of context in these
   representations for richer semantic understanding.

2. **Normalization Process**: Normalize vectors to unit length to ensure the
   similarity measure is not affected by vector magnitude. This step is crucial
   for a fair comparison of cosine similarity.

3. **Distance Measure**: Apply cosine similarity between normalized vectors as a
   measure of semantic closeness. This can be indicative of underlying semantic
   relationships.

4. **Contextual Information Integration**: Discuss how context can be embedded
   into vector representations, such as using sequence models or attention
   mechanisms.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**: Explore methods like t-SNE or PCA
   for making high-dimensional vectors more manageable, potentially uncovering
   semantic patterns.

6. **Evaluation**: Employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate
   the approach. Discuss potential metrics and analysis techniques to assess the
   correlation between cosine similarity scores and actual semantic similarity.
