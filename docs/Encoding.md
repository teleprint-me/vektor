Exploration of Cosine Similarity with Encoded Token Vectors

Cosine similarity is a staple in natural language processing for measuring the
semantic similarity between two vectors. It's particularly effective with dense
embeddings from models trained to capture contextual information. The use of
cosine similarity with encodings, as opposed to embeddings, presents an
unconventional approach, yet it may yield insightful results.

Steps to Utilize Cosine Similarity with Encoded Vectors:

1. Vector Representation: Sparse vectors can be obtained by mapping encoded
   tokens onto a high-dimensional vector space.
2. Normalization: Normalize vectors to enable the effective use of cosine
   similarity, making sure the vector lengths do not affect the similarity
   measure.
3. Distance Measure: Apply cosine similarity to measure the distance between
   normalized vectors, interpreting this as an indication of semantic
   similarity.
4. Contextual Information: Consider incorporating context into vector
   representations to capture more nuanced semantic meanings.
5. Dimensionality Reduction: Explore techniques like t-SNE or PCA for reducing
   dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces, which might make the vectors more
   manageable and reveal semantic structures.
6. Evaluation: Conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate the
   correlation between the cosine similarity of encoded vectors and true
   semantic similarity.

This document serves as a reminder of the thought process and rationale behind
considering cosine similarity for use with sparse encoded token vectors. The key
to success lies in the meaningful representation of semantic information within
the structure of the vector space.
