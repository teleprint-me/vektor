Combining words, characters, and subwords to form a vocabulary that retains
semantic meaning while being computationally efficient is a strategy used in
several modern tokenization methods. To create numerical representations that
are reliable and consistent, we can explore a process that includes these
elements:

1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into tokens that could be full words,
   subwords, or characters. This could be achieved by first splitting on
   whitespace and punctuation for words and then applying further subdivision
   rules for subwords or characters in specific cases (e.g., for very long words
   or to handle rare words not found in the corpus).

2. **Unique Identifier Assignment**: Assign a unique numerical identifier to
   each token. This could be a simple incrementing index or something more
   sophisticated like a hash function. The goal is to have a consistent way to
   refer to the same token across different contexts.

3. **Vector Representation**:

   - For words and subwords, you could represent each token as a sparse vector
     where the index of the token in the vocabulary determines the position of
     the '1' in a one-hot encoding scheme.
   - For characters, you could use their ASCII or Unicode code points directly
     since there are a finite number of characters, and they are consistently
     used across different words.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: The sparse vectors can be quite
   high-dimensional, especially for large vocabularies. To address this, apply a
   dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA or an autoencoder to derive
   dense vector representations of each token that preserve as much semantic
   information as possible.

5. **Encoding Function**: Design an encoding function that maps the tokens to
   their dense vector representations. This function should be deterministic and
   based on the rules you've set for tokenization and the dimensionality
   reduction process.

6. **Clustering for Semantic Similarity (Optional)**: If desired, perform
   clustering on the dense vectors to group semantically similar tokens. This
   could help in reducing the vocabulary size and ensuring that similar meanings
   are captured by proximal points in the vector space.

7. **Vocabulary Construction**: The final vocabulary consists of the dense
   vector representations of each unique token. This vocabulary can be used
   directly in models that require numerical input, such as neural networks.

8. **Consistency and Reliability**: Ensure that the encoding function is
   consistent (the same token always maps to the same vector) and reliable (the
   vectors represent the semantic meaning of the tokens as accurately as
   possible).

This process synthesizes the granular control of character-level tokenization
with the semantic richness of word-level tokenization, providing a balance that
could work well for many NLP tasks.

specific steps in more detail?
