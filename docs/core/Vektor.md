# Vektor Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Vektor` class is a specialized, streamlined Python library designed
explicitly for neural network applications. Its lean implementation,
encompassing just 100 lines of code, provides essential matrix operations with
an emphasis on simplicity and clarity. This makes `Vektor` ideal for educational
purposes, prototyping, and small to medium-scale neural network projects.

## Initialization

`Vektor` instances can be created with predefined matrices or specified
dimensions, focusing on neural network requirements.

### Syntax

```python
Vektor(matrix: Optional[List[List[float]]] = None, shape: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None, dtype: Type = float)
```

- `matrix`: A list of lists representing the matrix, primarily for initializing
  weights and inputs.
- `shape`: Dimensions of the matrix (rows, columns), particularly useful for
  creating weight matrices.
- `dtype`: Data type of the matrix elements, defaulting to `float`.

## Core Methods

### Matrix Addition (`__add__`)

Adds another `Vektor`, useful for incorporating biases in neural computations.

### Matrix Subtraction (`__sub__`)

Subtracts another `Vektor`, a less common but available operation.

### Elementwise Multiplication (`__mul__`)

Performs Hadamard product, useful in certain neural network operations.

### Matrix Multiplication (`__matmul__`)

Executes dot product, essential for calculating neuron activations.

### Transpose (`T`)

Returns the transpose, key in aligning matrices for multiplication.

### Shape

Provides the matrix dimensions, crucial for validating neural network
architecture integrity.

## Example Usage in Neural Networks

```python
from vektor.core.vektor import Vektor
import random

# Initialize weights and bias for a neural network layer
weights = Vektor(shape=(1, 3))
bias = Vektor(matrix=[[random.gauss(0, 1)]])
inputs = Vektor(matrix=[[0.5, -1, 0.2]])

# Perform a neural network computation
output = inputs @ weights.T + bias
```

## Error Handling

`Vektor` robustly handles errors like shape mismatches, ensuring operations
align with neural network principles.

## Performance

Optimized for clarity and simplicity in smaller-scale neural network tasks. For
very large-scale or real-time applications, performance should be evaluated.

## Educational and Practical Applications

`Vektor` is an excellent tool for teaching neural network fundamentals and for
prototype development, offering an easy-to-understand interface.

## Conclusion

The `Vektor` class, with its focused and concise design, is a powerful tool for
those embarking on or teaching neural network concepts in Python. It provides a
clear and straightforward way to perform critical matrix operations, embodying
an ideal blend of educational value and practical utility for specific neural
network applications.
