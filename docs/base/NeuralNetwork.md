# Neural Network Module Documentation (Draft)

## Overview

The Neural Network module is a core component of the Vektor library, designed to
facilitate the creation, modification, and management of neural networks. This
module adopts a Pythonic approach, emphasizing readability, ease of use, and
leveraging Python's native features to provide a user-friendly interface for
both beginners and advanced users in the field of machine learning.

## 1. Introduction

The `NeuralNetwork` class within the Vektor library is designed as a flexible
and intuitive foundation for building various types of neural networks. Its
unique structure allows users to interact with the network as if it were a
regular Python list, simplifying the process of constructing and manipulating
neural network architectures.

## 2. Design Philosophy

The design philosophy centers around three key principles:

- **Simplicity**: Keeping the interface and usage straightforward.
- **Pythonic Design**: Embracing Python’s built-in features and idiomatic
  patterns to ensure that the class is intuitive to Python developers.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Allowing for easy customization and
  extension to cater to a wide range of neural network architectures and
  applications.

## 3. Class Overview

### `NeuralNetwork`

- **Description**: The `NeuralNetwork` class acts as a base for creating and
  working with neural networks. It allows for dynamic construction and
  modification of networks with varying architectures.
- **Attributes**:
  - `_layers`: A list of layers in the network, maintaining the sequence and
    structure of the model.
  - `_architecture`: A detailed specification of the network’s structure, used
    for initialization and reconstruction.
- **Methods**:
  - `__init__`: Initializes the network, optionally using an architectural
    blueprint.
  - `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__len__`, `__contains__`: Enable indexing,
    slicing, length checking, and membership testing, akin to standard Python
    lists.
  - `build_network`: Constructs the network based on a given architecture
    specification.
- **Properties**:
  - `layers`: Provides access to the current list of layers in the network.
  - `architecture`: Returns the architectural blueprint of the network.

## 4. Special Features

- **List-like Behavior**: One of the standout features of the `NeuralNetwork`
  class is its list-like behavior. This design choice simplifies many common
  operations, such as adding or replacing layers, and makes the class more
  intuitive.
- **Dynamic Architecture Management**: The class allows for dynamic
  modifications to the network's structure, reflecting changes immediately in
  the architecture property.

## 5. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating and Initializing a Network

```python
# Import the necessary classes
from vektor.base.neural_network import NeuralNetwork
from vektor.activations.tanh import Tanh
from vektor.layers.dense import Dense

# Define the architecture
architecture = [
    {"type": "Dense", "input_dim": 784, "output_dim": 64},
    {"type": "Tanh"},
    {"type": "Dense", "input_dim": 64, "output_dim": 10}
]

# Initialize the Neural Network with the specified architecture
network = NeuralNetwork(architecture=architecture)

# Alternatively, create an empty network and add layers dynamically
empty_network = NeuralNetwork()
empty_network.add_layer({"type": "Dense", "input_dim": 784, "output_dim": 64})
empty_network.add_layer({"type": "Tanh"})
empty_network.add_layer({"type": "Dense", "input_dim": 64, "output_dim": 10})
```

### Example 2: Accessing and Modifying Layers

```python
# Access the first layer
first_layer = network[0]

# Modify the second layer (assuming compatible dimensions)
network[1] = Dense(64, 128)

# Access the last layer using negative indexing
last_layer = network[-1]

# Iterate over the layers
for layer in network:
    print(layer)
```

### Example 3: Extending the Network

```python
# Add a new layer at the end
network.add_layer({"type": "Tanh"})

# Insert a layer at a specific position
network[2] = Dense(128, 64)

# Check the length of the network
print(f"Number of layers: {len(network)}")

# Check if a specific layer is in the network
is_in_network = Dense(64, 128) in network
```

### Example 4: Saving and Loading the Network

```python
# Assuming implementation of save and load methods
network.save("my_network.h5")

# Load the network
loaded_network = NeuralNetwork()
loaded_network.load("my_network.h5")
```

## 6. Development Notes

### Initial Design and Evolution

- The development of the `NeuralNetwork` class began with a conventional
  approach focusing on explicit methods for layer management (`add_layer`,
  `get_layer`, `set_layer`).
- As development progressed, there was a recognition for a need for a more
  intuitive and flexible interface, leading to a significant design shift.

### Embracing Pythonic Principles

- A key decision was to align the class design with Pythonic principles,
  emphasizing readability, simplicity, and leveraging built-in Python features.
- This led to the adoption of list-like behavior for the class, utilizing
  special dunder methods to allow users to interact with the network as if it
  were a standard Python list.

### Challenges and Solutions

- One of the main challenges was balancing flexibility and simplicity. This
  ensured the class was both powerful and easy to use.
- Careful consideration was used to address which Python features to leverage
  (like negative indexing and dynamic resizing) and how to implement them in a
  way that felt natural to Python users.
- Ensuring robustness and clear error messaging was another focus, particularly
  when users interacted with the network in unexpected ways.

### Iterative Development and Testing

- The development process was iterative, with continuous testing and refinement.
  Design choices were regularly revisited and reassessed, ensuring they met
  basic goals for the class.
- Comprehensive testing was conducted to cover a wide range of use cases and
  scenarios, ensuring the class behaved as expected and gracefully handled
  errors.

### Future Development Considerations

- While the current implementation meets initial goals, it's open to future
  enhancements and refinements.
- Plans to monitor evolving use cases to inform any future updates or additions
  to the class.

## 7. Future Work

The development of the `NeuralNetwork` class within the Vektor project is an
ongoing journey of exploration and learning. Looking ahead, there are several
areas of focus and potential advancements:

### Expanding Model Capabilities

  network architectures, such as those involving multi-head attention
  mechanisms, commonly found in Transformer models.

  offer novel functionalities or optimizations, enhancing the capabilities of
  the neural network framework.

### Application-Specific Enhancements

- **NLP-Focused Features**: As the project has a strong focus on text generation
  and NLP tasks, future work includes tuning and optimizing the network for
  these specific applications.
- **Multi-Modal Extensions**: Consider extending the neural network framework to
  handle multi-modal data, enabling its application in a broader range of
  scenarios beyond text.

### Performance and Scalability

- **Efficiency Improvements**: Continuously seek ways to optimize the
  performance of the network, especially in handling larger datasets or more
  complex models.

  both in terms of model size and the ability to handle extensive training
  datasets.

### Usability and Accessibility

- **User-Friendly Enhancements**: Enhance the usability of the network class by
  refining the interface, adding more intuitive methods, and improving
  documentation.
