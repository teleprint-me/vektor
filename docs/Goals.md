Project: Vektor Tokenization System

Main Goals Document

1. Language Agnosticism:
   - Develop a tokenization system that is not tied to any specific language or script.
   - Ensure the method can handle diverse linguistic phenomena and scripts.

2. Semantic Preservation:
   - Ensure that the tokenization process maintains the semantic meaning of the text as much as possible.
   - Explore the integration of semantic understanding into the tokenization process.

3. Efficiency:
   - Create a tokenization method that is computationally efficient and can be scaled for large datasets.
   - Implement effective compression schemes for the numerical representations of tokens.

4. Innovation:
   - Experiment with novel approaches to tokenization that diverge from established methods like WordPiece or BPE.
   - Encourage creative solutions to tokenization that may not follow traditional NLP paradigms.

5. Machine Learning Compatibility:
   - Ensure that the tokenized output is suitable for use with machine learning models, particularly in NLP tasks.
   - Evaluate the quality of tokenization based on its impact on the performance of machine learning models.

6. Benchmarking and Evaluation:
   - Establish benchmarks for the tokenization system against current methods.
   - Set up a systematic evaluation process to assess the effectiveness of the tokenization.

7. Community Engagement and Feedback:
   - Share progress and seek feedback from the NLP and open-source communities.
   - Incorporate community input to refine and improve the tokenization method.

8. Research and Development:
   - Stay updated with the latest research in NLP and tokenization.
   - Use insights from academic literature to inform the development of the tokenization system.

9. Iterative Improvement:
   - Adopt an iterative approach to developing the tokenization system.
   - Use each iteration as a learning opportunity and a step towards the final goal.

10. Documentation:
    - Maintain comprehensive documentation of the project's progress, methodologies, and findings.
    - Ensure that the documentation is clear and detailed to assist future work on the project.
