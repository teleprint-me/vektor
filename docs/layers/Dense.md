# Development and Testing of the Dense Layer

## Introduction

This document outlines the process of developing and testing the `Dense` layer
for the neural network framework in the project. It covers the design decisions,
implementation details, and testing strategies employed to ensure the robustness
and reliability of the layer.

## Development Process

### Design Considerations

- **Objective**: To implement a `Dense` layer class that serves as a fundamental
  building block for constructing neural networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Support for various activation functions.
  - Proper weight initialization strategies like He and Xavier/Glorot
    Initialization.
  - Forward and backward propagation capabilities.

### Implementation Details

- **Initialization**: Weights and biases are initialized based on the chosen
  activation function.
- **Activation Functions**: The layer supports 'relu', 'tanh', and 'sigmoid',
  with specific initialization strategies for each.
- **Forward Propagation**: Implemented to process input data and apply the
  layer's weights and biases.
- **Backward Propagation**: Implemented to compute gradients and update the
  layer's parameters, including regularization.

## Testing Strategy

### Overview

A comprehensive suite of tests was developed to validate each aspect of the
`Dense` layer's functionality.

### Test Suite Composition

- **Initialization Test**: Ensures weights and biases are initialized correctly.
- **Forward Propagation Test**: Verifies the layer's output given a sample
  input.
- **Backward Propagation Test**: Checks the layer's gradient computation and
  parameter updating process.
- **Parameter Management Test**: Tests the functionality of getting and setting
  layer parameters.
- **Activation Function Compatibility Test**: Uses parameterized tests to ensure
  compatibility with different activation functions.

### Execution and Results

- The test suite was executed with `pytest`.
- All tests passed successfully, indicating that the `Dense` layer behaves as
  expected under various conditions.

## Conclusion

The development and testing of the `Dense` layer have established a solid
foundation for the neural network components in the project. The rigorous
testing process ensures the layer's functionality and reliability, paving the
way for further development and integration into more complex network
architectures.
