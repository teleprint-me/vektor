# Semantic Vocabulary Construction

The creation of a vocabulary that combines words, characters, and subwords is
crucial in retaining semantic meaning while ensuring computational efficiency.
This document outlines a process for developing such a vocabulary.

## Process Overview

The following steps outline the method for creating numerical representations of
text data:

### 1. Tokenization

Split text into tokens, which could be:

- Full words
- Subwords
- Characters

**Method**:

- Begin by dividing based on whitespace and punctuation.
- Apply further subdivision for special cases.

### 2. Unique Identifier Assignment

Assign a unique numerical identifier to each token using:

- An incrementing index
- A hash function

### 3. Vector Representation

**For words and subwords**:

- Utilize a sparse vector representation with one-hot encoding.

**For characters**:

- Employ ASCII or Unicode code points.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction

Reduce the high-dimensional sparse vectors using techniques like:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

### 5. Encoding Function

Develop a deterministic function that maps tokens to dense vectors, adhering to
the tokenization rules and the chosen dimensionality reduction method.

### 6. Clustering for Semantic Similarity (Optional)

Perform clustering on the dense vectors to group semantically similar tokens,
which aids in vocabulary size reduction.

### 7. Vocabulary Construction

Combine the dense vectors to form the final vocabulary, ready for use in
numerical models.

### 8. Consistency and Reliability

Guarantee the encoding function's consistency and the vectors' reliability in
representing tokens' semantic meaning.

## Conclusion

This structured approach aims to blend the precision of character-level
tokenization with the contextual richness of word-level representations,
offering a robust solution for various NLP applications.
