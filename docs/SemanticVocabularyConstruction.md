# Semantic Vocabulary Construction

This document serves as a guide for developing a semantic vocabulary that
integrates words, characters, and subwords, balancing semantic richness with
computational efficiency. It outlines a methodical process for creating
numerical representations of text data, suitable for various NLP applications.

## Process Overview

### 1. Tokenization

**Objective**: Split text into meaningful tokens, which can be full words,
subwords, or characters.

**Method**:

- Start by dividing text based on whitespace and punctuation.
- Further subdivide for special cases, like compound words or contractions.

### 2. Unique Identifier Assignment

**Objective**: Assign a unique numerical identifier to each token.

**Method**:

- Use an incrementing index or a hash function for unique identification.

### 3. Vector Representation

**Objective**: Represent tokens as vectors.

**Method**:

- For words and subwords: Use a sparse vector representation with one-hot
  encoding.
- For characters: Employ ASCII or Unicode code points.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction

**Objective**: Reduce the high-dimensional vectors to more manageable sizes.

**Method**:

- Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for linear
  dimensionality reduction or Autoencoders for a non-linear approach.

### 5. Encoding Function

**Objective**: Develop a deterministic function mapping tokens to dense vectors.

**Method**:

- Ensure the function adheres to the tokenization rules and chosen
  dimensionality reduction method.

### 6. Clustering for Semantic Similarity (Optional)

**Objective**: Group semantically similar tokens to aid in vocabulary size
reduction.

**Method**:

- Perform clustering on the dense vectors using algorithms like k-means or
  hierarchical clustering.

### 7. Vocabulary Construction

**Objective**: Combine dense vectors to form the final vocabulary.

**Method**:

- Integrate vectors ensuring coverage of all token types and maintaining
  semantic integrity.

### 8. Consistency and Reliability

**Objective**: Ensure the encoding function's consistency and vectors'
reliability.

**Method**:

- Regularly test and validate the representation accuracy of tokens' semantic
  meaning.

## Use Cases

This semantic vocabulary can be integrated into NLP models for tasks such as:

- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation

## Conclusion

By blending character-level precision with word-level context, this approach
offers a robust solution for constructing semantic vocabularies in NLP. The
process is designed to be adaptable, catering to a wide range of applications in
the field.
